Question 1
Write a function “insert_any()” for inserting a node at any given position of the linked list. Assume
position starts at 0.
The following program illustrates the process of inserting a node at any specific position and i have inserted the new node after a given node-

void insertAfter(struct Node* prev_node, int new_data)  
{  
    if (prev_node == NULL)  
    {  
    printf("the given previous node cannot be NULL");      
    return;  
    }  
    struct Node* new_node =(struct Node*) malloc(sizeof(struct Node));  
    new_node->data = new_data;  
    new_node->next = prev_node->next;  
    prev_node->next = new_node;  
}

Question 2
Write a function “delete_beg()” for deleting a node from the beginning of the linked list.
The following function will illustrate how to delete a node from the beginning of the linked list

struct node *delete_beg(struct node *start)
{
struct node *ptr;
ptr = start;
start = start -> next;
free(ptr);
return start;
}


Question 3
Write a function “delete_end()” for deleting a node from the end of the linked list.
The following function will illustrate how to delete a node from the end of the linked list
struct node *delete_end(struct node *start)
{
struct node *ptr, *preptr;
ptr = start;
while(ptr -> next != NULL)
{
 preptr = ptr;
 ptr = ptr -> next;
}
preptr -> next = NULL;
free(ptr);
return start;
}
